# pretend-your-there
A simple little script that moves the mouse pointer to make windows think that you are hard at work.  Keeps the screensaver away and prevents MS Teams to change your status to "away", amongst other things.

Writen in AutoIt, to keep the windows workstation alive while working on other computers.
