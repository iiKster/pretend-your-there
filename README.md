# pretend-your-there
A simple little script that moves the mouse pointer to make windows think that you are hard at work.  Keeps the screensaver away and prevents MS Teams to change your status to "away", amongst other things.  Exit the script and gain controll over your mouse by hitting ESC or wiggling the mouse violently. 

Written in AutoIt, to keep the windows workstation alive while working on other computers.
The .au3 file is the code for your convenience, play around with it if you please.  The .exe is the code compiled ready to roll.


Windows Defender may think that the file is a threat, if you don't trust a random .exe off the internet please compile the code.
